## Coding Challenge
In this challenge, you will create an application that allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete products.

Requirements

The application must be implemented using a RESTful service for the backend, written in Node.js version 10 or higher. You may use TypeScript.
The front-end must be implemented using Angular version 4 or higher.
Each product shall have the following attributes
       - Name (must be a string between 3 and 100 characters and must be unique in the system)

       - Description (must be a string between 5 and 1000 characters)

       - Price (must be a number between 1 and 20,000 with 2 decimal place precision)

   4. The application shall allow the user to create new products

   5. The application shall allow the user to list all of the products in the system

   6. The application shall allow the user to retrieve the details of any product by its name

   7. The application shall allow the user to update a productâ€™s description or price

   8. The application shall allow the user to delete a product



The intent of this project is not to assess your UX skills, but rather to see that you can implement a rudimentary front-end in Angular with a RESTful backend. You do not have to use a database unless you have time or want to, and make sure you have both frontend and backend validation.

When you are finished, upload your project to Github and share the repository or submit a zip file containing your source code and all resources necessary to run the project. You can assume we will have access to public services such as Docker Hub or the NPM public registry if you would like us to build your project from the command line.

Include a README.md file with instructions on how to build/run the project.

# JoshuaMaxwell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
